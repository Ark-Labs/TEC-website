    The Maker’s Ark fork from the Ark blockchain and may be added to any Ark
    desktop wallet using the MAKE network hash ID and the instructions at
    blog.ark.io. A TheShop.Build branded Ark compatible wallet is also available
    for download at TheShop.Build for desktop and mobile devices.

    Makers Ark is a Delegated Proof of Stake, DPoS, blockchain, in which 51
    active delegates are voted on by token holders to secure and maintain the
    network. As such, the MAKE network is ultimately owned and controlled by the
    users through their voting for the delegates. There is an inflation rate
    determined by a constant 2 MAKE tokens per block forged by the delegate
    creating the block, with a new block created every 8 seconds, resulting in
    an initial inflation of 6.31% for the first year, 5.93% for the second year
    the percentage of which decreases with each subsequent year with the
    constant creation rate of new MAKE ending with 4.02% in the 10th year. DPoS
    has proven to be a fast, reliable, and efficient blockchain technology
    requiring far less energy and computing resources than other consensus
    methods…

    The Ark based wallets are very secure and easier to use than most other
    blockchain wallets, and do not require the download and installation of the
    entire blockchain. A hardware USB device, the Ledger Nano, is available from
    either the Ark store, TheShop.Build, at Ark.io or Ledger.io to further
    secure the desktop wallet from hacks and keystroke loggers, and is highly
    recommended for MAKE and any other significant crypto holdings of supported
    tokens, including Ark and Ark based tokens. Unlike other Ledger wallets, the
    Ark based wallets are standalone, not requiring Chrome browser extensions or
    use in any browser.

    The Makers Ark token is a utility token that allows access to technology
    based products and technology based services of TheShop.Build and does not
    represent any equity share in TheShop.Build Inc., and there is no guarantee
    of any value other than in exchange for offerings by TheShop.Build at an
    exchange rate to be determined by TheShop.Build which will likely vary
    according to prevailing market conditions. There is also no guarantee that
    Makers Ark tokens will be listed on an exchange since that is up to the
    individual exchanges, and not under the control or determined by the Makers
    Ark team, Inc.
